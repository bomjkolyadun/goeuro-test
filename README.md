# GoEuro Test App

This is an implementation of [GoEuro Test App](https://github.com/goeuro/iOS-Test)

## Requirments
- Latest Cocoapods
- Xcode 8.3.3 or newer
- iOS 8.0+. This was done intentionally to be able mix Swift, Objective-C and Dynamic Frameworks. Unfortunately in 2017 it's a pain to use combination of Static Libraries, Dependency Managers (such as CocoaPods or Carthage) and Swift. Also it's pain to install an outdated Xcode, which supports iOS 7 as deployment target.
- iPhone 5s+

## How To Build
- Clone the repo
- CocoaPod dependencies were intentionally put to the repo to simplify everything. 
- Launch GoEuro/GoEuro.xcworkspace
- Build GoEuro target
- Launch the app and test the result.

## Third-Party Libs
- AFNetworking â€“ to simplify client-server interactions.
